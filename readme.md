# Assignment 3 Linked Queue
Mico Santiago

1. Uses a linked-list to store values in the queue

    - Create linked list like shown in mini lectures

2. Has an (add) enqueue method that will appropriately add a value to the back of the queue as an appropriate element

    - This means our linked queue will add a value in the back

3. has a (remove) dequeue method that will appropriately remove an element from the front of the queue and return its value

    - Remove a element from the front, therefore we are making a FIFO queue.

4. Optionally has a peek method that returns the value at the front of the queue without removing it
Bonus if you also create an array based Queue!

    - Must have this for testing, will be done similarly to mini lectures.
